There are other related repositories to this one:
* [images-client-plugin](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/images-client-plugin) - a grails plugin to provide a Javascript based viewer to be used in other applications requiring a image viewer. This viewer is based on LeafletJS.
* [image-tiling-agent](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/image-tiling-agent) - a utility to run tiling jobs for the image-service. This is intended to used on multiple machine as tiling is CPU intensive and best parallelised.
* [image-loader](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/image-loader) - utility for bulk loading images into the image-service.
